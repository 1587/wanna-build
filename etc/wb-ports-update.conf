# Configuration for wb-update
#
# It is a rather simple script, so please follow the following
# guidelines :)
#
# Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you
# like.  Note that an in-line comment is not supported.  If a line
# consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will
# be ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING
# ELSE IS PARSED!!!
